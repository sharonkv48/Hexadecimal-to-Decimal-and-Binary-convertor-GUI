this is a hexadecimal to decimal and binary convertor GUI
if we give a hexadecimal value, this gui will convert that hexadecimal to its equivalent decimal and binary value
for making this gui we are using the module named PySimpleGUI
if you don't have this module installed in your python, you can install it by opening your command box and typing this command
pip install PySimpleGUI

if you give non hexadecimal value, this gui will show an error message saying, you have entered an incorrect hexadeccimal value
